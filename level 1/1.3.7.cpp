//  Write a C-program that efficiently multiplies a number by a factor 2 to the power n. The number to multiply and n are variables, which get a value at the start of the program.

//
//Clue:1 shift to the left is the same as multiplying by 2.
//2 shifts to the left are the same as multiplying by 4.
//3 shifts to the left are the same as multiplying by 8.
