//Create a C-program that uses the fact that 0 (zero) is
//interpreted as FALSE and non-zero is interpreted as TRUE.
//The C-program can be made easier to read when this 0 (or non-
//zero) is assigned to a variable e.g. an int called married.
//Use the ?: operator to print if someone is married or not.
//(See if you can use a single printf)
/*
// A?1:0 means reutnr 1 if A is true
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int married=2;
    printf("is he/she married? %s\n", married?"True":"False");
    return 0;
