/*1.3.2
Write a program that calculates the surface of a triangle with
one 90 degree angle. The formula is half the height multiplied
by the base. The program should take an input from
the user (base & height), and output the result.

int main()
{
    double base;
    double height;

    printf("Enter base: ");
    scanf("%lf", &base); // %lf is used for double
                         //&base is the memory address of base
    printf("Enter height: ");
    scanf("%lf", &height);
    
    printf("Area is: %lf",(0.5*height*base));
    
    return 0;
